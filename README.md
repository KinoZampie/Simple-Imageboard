# Simple Imageboard
A simple imageboard created using Flask and SQLite

Was supposed to be a quick sample project for me to use to create docker containers but snowballed into a day project. 

# Installation
Download: `git clone https://github.com/KinoZampie/Simple-Imageboard/`

`cd Simple-Imageboard`

Install Dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Run it! `python3 app.py`
